# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Objective

In this project, I'll build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, recognizes the faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

## Result
This project is still under development. Stay tuned.
